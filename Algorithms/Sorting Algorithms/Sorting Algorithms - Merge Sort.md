# Merge Sort
1. Divide: The list is divided into two (or more) sublists. This division continues recursively until each sublist has only one element or is empty. These single-element sublists are inherently sorted.

2. Conquer: The algorithm then merges the sublists to produce new sorted sublists. This merge step is the crucial part where sorting actually happens.

3. Combine: This step involves merging these sorted sublists repeatedly to produce a new sorted list.

## Complexity
 - Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst).
 - Space Complexity: O(n) due to the use of temporary arrays.

## Code Example

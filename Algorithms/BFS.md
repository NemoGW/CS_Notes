The core idea of BFS Algorithem is simply just imagine that there is a node, and every node has a linked to other nodes. Generally we will be using **LinkedList** data structures to perform BFS.

The main difference bettwen BFS and DFS is that **BFS will find the shortest path, but it will be having a bigger space complexity than DFS**

### Algorithm

Problems involving using BFS will be some type of the following. **Asking you from a "graph", find the **start** and the **target** distance**.

For instance:
Walking through a maze, find the shortest path?
Having two strings, only one character can be changed at a time. How many times of changes are needed to change from String 1 to String 2?

Sudo code for BFS

```java
int BFS(Node start, Node target){
    Queue<Node> q; //the queue needed for bfs
    Set<Node> visited; //aviod duplicated nodes

    q.offer(start); //adding start
    visited.add(start);

    while(q not empty){
        int size = q.size();
        /* going to the next node/spread out the nodes in queue */
        for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
            Node cur = q.poll();
            /* going to the next node/spread out the nodes in queue */
            if(cur is target){
                return step;
            }
            /* else add the current node into queue */
            for(Node x : cur.adj()){
                if(x not in visited){
                    q.offer(x);
                    visited.add(x);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    /* no target */
    return no target
}
```

Q: Why to use DFS in some cases but not BFS

A: BFS can be use to find the shortest path, but it takes a **large space complexity** while DFS uses a less space complexity.

For instance, taking a binary tree as example, a full binary tree, with N nodes. Using DFS the space complexity will be to the worst case O(logN) because it depends on the recurrsion on stacks.

However, BFS for every level of the binary tree, you will need to store it. So the space complexity will be the number of lowest level nodes. Which will be ~ N/2. So O(N).
